# CGTerm-2.0
CGTerm 1.7 is updated from the original code found here on GitHub: https://github.com/MagerValp/CGTerm
I have updated the code to process english keyboards better and to allow for an easier mapping of custom keyboards.

Currently, requests for updates include compiling it for MacOS Big Sur, 11.2, and adding native menu's instead of using SDL.
I am not sure if I will have the time to implement any of these changes at the moment. My thoughts are to instead make the app a more universal app in Python instead of using C and relying on external libraires. Every time Apple revs their OS it becomes a pain to recompile. In Python, a new file could be generated rather easy.

Any comments or notes, can be left for me at cgterm and then my github user name.com
